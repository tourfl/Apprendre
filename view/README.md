# view & controller

## Still **TO DO**

### Learn part

- information: score, headers, date, author, number of runs
- design: button's position, score progress bar
- functionality: random run through data, retry, retry only wrong

maybe multiple lists... need to think, because it would be some work to design.
maybe random run is not relevant.


### Post part

- everything to do!

### User data

- user profiles, with /working rate/, /efficiency rate/

## View

It must be really minimalistic, so I choose this css: Pure

# arrangement of vocabulary columns

- sections sorted by size
